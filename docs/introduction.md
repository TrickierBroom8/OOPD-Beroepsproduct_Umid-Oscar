# YAEGER_

Yaeger is Another Education Game Engine Runtime, and a fully functional 2D
game-engine that requires only a traditional Object-Oriented style of
programming. To create a game, classes should be extended and interfaces
should be implemented.

Its API is based on inheritance and composition and can be seen as a layer of
abstraction on top of JavaFX. JavaFX is only exposed minimally, so it is not
trivially possible to use JavaFX within Yaeger. This is by design.

## Required Java version

Although Yaeger only exposes a traditional Object Oriented API, internally its
based on modern Java. To see which specific version is required, please read
the [readme](https://github.com/han-yaeger/yaeger) on the project GitHub.

## Howto read this manual

This manual is only meant to give a high-level overview. It will paint a
picture of how a game can be created and what kind of objects are available.
The details and specifics will not be part of this manual. They can be found in
the [JavaDoc API](https://han-yaeger.github.io/yaeger/).
